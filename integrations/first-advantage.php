                </h4>
                <p>
                    First Advantage offers one of the most comprehensive multi-family housing screening and
                    collections services available for the industry. We enable property owners and managers to
                    effectively evaluate residents during the application phase, monitor them after move-in and
                    locate them after theyâ€™ve moved out, if necessary. With First Advantage, property managers can
                    quickly turn qualified applicants into residents, and help protect their property from problem
                    renters. As a result, property owners and managers can avoid both financial losses and potential
                    liability.
