&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>ResMan Uptime Commitment.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="99">
	<li>Subject to the terms of this SLA, ResMan will have a 99.9% Availability each calendar month (the “Uptime Commitment”). The availability of ResMan for a given month will be calculated according to the following formula (referred to herein as the “Availability”). Where:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Total qualifying minutes in the month = TQM = Number of days*12*60</li>
	<li>Total minutes in month unavailable between 7am and 7pm Central Time= TMU</li>
	<li>and: Availability = (TQM-TMU)/TQM.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>For purposes of this calculation, ResMan will be deemed to be unavailable to the extent the applicable ResMan will not accept connections. ResMan will not be deemed Unavailable for any downtime or outages excluded from such calculation by reason of the exceptions set forth below in this SLA. Company’s records and data will be the sole basis for all SLA calculations and determinations.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>Maintenance and Other Exceptions.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>ResMan will not be considered to be Unavailable for any outage that results from any maintenance performed by Company (i) of which You is notified at least 24 hours in advance; (ii) during Your implementation period; (iii) during Company’s then-current standard maintenance windows (collectively, the “Scheduled Maintenance”); or (iv) as a result of Your request outside of the normally scheduled maintenance.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>ResMan will not be considered Unavailable for any outage due to (i) Your Data or application programming, acts or omissions of You or its agents, failures of equipment or facilities provided by You, network unavailability or bandwidth limitations outside of the ResMan network; (ii) issues arising from bugs or other problems in the software, firmware or hardware of Company’s partners; or (iii) force majeure events. The configuration being provided under this SLA is based on assumptions made by You and based on information provided by You. As a result, Company will not be responsible, under this SLA or otherwise, for any outages or performance issues caused by inaccuracies in these assumptions, including equipment and software failures or performance problems caused by traffic volume or the number of concurrent user sessions.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>  Configuration Changes; You Supported Software.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>This SLA is based on a standard configuration of the SaaS Subscriptions to provide the performance level contemplated by the Uptime Commitment in this SLA. If Company notifies You that it has determined that Your configuration is not suited to provide this level of performance, this SLA will be suspended until You and Company agree upon and implement a new or modified configuration designed to provide this level of performance.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li>SLA Remedies.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

You will have the rights set forth below relating to Company’s provision of the SaaS Subscriptions. This SLA provides Your sole and exclusive remedy for Company’s failure to provide the SaaS Subscriptions or meet the Uptime Commitment. All standards and commitments are subject to the limitations and exclusions set forth herein.

&nbsp;

If the Availability of ResMan Subscriptions for a given month is less than the applicable Uptime Commitment, You may receive a prorated service credit for the affected SaaS Subscriptions for such month lower than 99.9%.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To receive service credits, You must submit a written request to support@resmancloud.com, within thirty (30) days after the end of the month in which the ResMan Subscriptions failed to meet the Uptime Commitment, or Your right to receive service credits with respect to such unavailability will be waived.
